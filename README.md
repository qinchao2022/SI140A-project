# SI140A-project
Reverse engineering mechanism of Wechat envelope -- SI140A final project for 2023 Fall

In our project, we try to reverse-engineer the random allocation mechanism of WeChat Red Envelope, which is known as the WRE. We devide our project into following steps:
1. Observation: including data processing and obtain an intuitively speaking of our collected data
2. Modeling: from data we've collected, we find the regularity inside it and design our own model based on implicit assumptions
3. Validation: we use the model we've designed and simulate the large number of envelopes, to validate that our model has a similar performance to the true data microscropically
4. Decision Making: based on our model designed, find out the better or best strategy when to grab an envelope
5. Further exploration: we additionally come up with ideas of some interesting things and try to give some strategy or solution to it

Timeline:
1. data processing （12/29 - 1/3）

2. modeling（1/3 - 1/7）

3. validation（1/8 - 1/11）

4. decision making & furthur exploration（1/12 - 1/20）
